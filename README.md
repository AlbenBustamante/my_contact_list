# My Contact List
It's a RESTful API of a contact book, simple and easy to use.

### How does it work?
First you must register a new address book with the name you want.

You have the freedom to create as many contact lists as necessary.

On the contacts side, all the attributes are only character type except for the contact book ID.

It is quite an easy and practical application to use, made for educational and personal purposes.

### How can I use the application?

You can access the application here: 
- https://alnicode-my-contact-list.herokuapp.com/mycontactlist/api/swagger-ui/
- `username: my_admin`
- `password: adminroot123`

### How did I do it?

I developed it from the Spring Boot Frameworks, Spring Data and Spring Security (basic security).

Also, I used some libraries like Validation for data validation, Mapstruct to map entities to data transfer objects, and Lombok.

The graphic environment is thanks to Swagger.
